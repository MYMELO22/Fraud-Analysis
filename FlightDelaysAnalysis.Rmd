Goal: Experience the Fraud Analytics Process Model

Background:
The Fraud Analytics Process Model:
1. ID Problem
2. ID Data Sources
3. Select Data
4. Clean Data
5. Transform Data
6. Analyze Data
7. Interpret Model
8. Refine Model

**The first ten questions are for the individual assignment and the remaining questions are for the team assignment. Specifically:**
**For the individual assignment submissions: Delete the everything below Q10. Then, knit and submit your html and Rmd files.**
**For the team assignment submissions: Pick any individual team member's answers for the first ten questions. Then complete the remaining questions to submit for the team assignment.**

1. Delete the everything below Q10 and submit for individual assignment.
2. Pick any individual team member's answers for the first ten questions and then knit the remaining questions to submit for the team assignment.

Individual assignment: 25 total points
Team assignment: 115 total points


## [1 point] Q1.
*Start by entering your name and today's date in Lines 3 and 4, respectively.* 
*Then, run the chunk of code below by clicking on the green arrow (that points to the right) on the top right of the chunk.*
*Tip: This line of code (knitr...) is generated by RStudio. It allows you to format (knit) your output so you can share in a readable format. We will use an html format for output as specified in Line 5. You will be instructed to "knit" after completing the assignment without any errors.*
*Tip: I numbered code chunks corresponding to their numbers. Chunk 1 specified the knitting parameters.*
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# 1. ID Problem: 
*Flight cancellations and delays due to weather are not the airlines' responsibility. Our goal is to detect and report any delays that are not due to weather for further investigation.*

# 2. ID Data Sources
*We will analyze data in nycflights13 because it contains information about all flights originating from NYC airports. Please take a moment to skim https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf with a focus on finding information about cancellations/delays and weather.*

## [2 points] Q2. 
*Install and load packages tidyverse and nycflights13.*
*Tip: tidyverse package gives you a tidy way of manipulating data.*
*Tip: install.packages("packageName") command installs package packageName. library(packageName) will load package packageName.*
*Tip: You only need to install packages once and you are free to load them afterwards. In fact, you will need to remove the install command to knit and submit your solutions.*
```{r}
options(repos = list(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

## [1 point] Q3. 
*Confirm that the package you loaded in the previous chunk by using the search() function. There is nothing enclosed in parentheses because search doesn't need any information (parameters).*
```{r}
search()

```

## [1 point] Q4. 
*Now, take a peek inside nycflights13 by using the command ls("package:nycflights13")*
*Tip: ls("package:packageName") gives the names of the objects in packageName.*
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
ls("package:nycflights13")
```

## [1 point] Q5. 
*Now, see what is in your environment by using the command ls() without anything inside the parentheses.*
*Tip: ls() provides information about data sets and functions defined by the user. This will give character(0) if there is nothing in the environment. It is a good idea to start every R script with a clean environment so previous data doesn't corrupt your script.* 
*Tip: You may clean your environment at any time by using the broom in the environment tab (likely near top right of RStudio) or using the command rm(list = ls()).*
```{r}
ls()

```

## [2 points] Q6.
*Find the tibbles that contain information about flight delays and weather using the information from nycflights13 documentation, and assign them to variables names of your choosing.*
*Tip: Tibbles are a more robust and refined version of data frames. (Google tibble if you want to learn more about tibbles but it is not necessary at this time.)*
*Tip: I name variables with an abbreviation of the data type followed by a description of the variable. For example, I would use tFlights for the tibble containing flights data so I know that it is a tibble by just reading the variable name. I don't mind long variable names because I copy-paste them. (You may learn more about naming conventions at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming).*
```{r}
tFlights = flights
tWeather = weather
dep_delay = flights$dep_delay
arr_delay = flights$arr_delay
```

## [1 point] Q7.
*Now, use ls() to see how your environment have changed.*
*Tip: Also, checkout the new variables in the environment tab.*
```{r}
ls()
```

## [2 points] Q8. 
*Use head function to print and check out the first 20 lines of the tibbles containing the flights and weather data.*
*Tip: Use https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf to understand the details of each data set.*
*Tip: Always check what you read into your program.*
*Tip: Get accustomed vertical and horizontal scrolling.*
*Tip: Get accustomed to clicking on different tabs when they are printed by one code chunk.*
```{r}
head(tFlights, 20)
head(tWeather, 20)
```

## [4 points] Q9. 
*Now, print the structure and summary statistics of the tibbles containing the flights and weather data.*
*Tip: Get accustomed to working with datasets that can't fit on a spreadsheet (and your head).*
```{r}
str(tFlights)
summary(tFlights)
str(tWeather)
summary(tWeather)
```


# 3. Select Data

## [10 points] Q10.
*Using the information above, identify columns of each tibble that you will need for your analysis.*
*Tip: Copy-paste from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf and then delete what you don't need after completing your analysis. This will serve as your data dictionary.*
*Tip: You may update this list as you progress through the rest of the assignment. Don't worry about getting it perfect right now.*
```{r}
### This section doesn't require code. Just list all the columns of each dataset you'll need for your analysis.### 
# arr_delay, dep_delay, time_hour, humid, temp

```

**For the individual assignment submissions: Delete the everything below this line. Then, knit and submit your html and Rmd files.**
**For the team assignment submissions: Pick any individual team member's answers for the first ten questions. Then complete the remaining questions to submit for the team assignment.**
